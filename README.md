# Machine-Translation-Decoder
This repository contains Python implementation of machine translation decoders. It includes multiple decoding algorithms: a monotone decoder, a non-monotonic decoder with phrase reordering, and an advanced decoder using beam search with future cost estimation. It aims to compare these algorithms in terms of translation quality and efficiency.
